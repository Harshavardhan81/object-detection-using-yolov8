# Object Detection and Classification using YOLOv8  

This repository contains an implementation of **object detection and classification** using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once, version 8) from **Ultralytics**. The model can detect and classify objects in **images, videos, and real-time streams** with high accuracy and efficiency.  


## ðŸš€ Features  
- Real-time **object detection** and **classification**  
- Works with **images, videos, and webcam streams**  
- Pre-trained YOLOv8 models and **custom dataset training**  
- Bounding boxes with **class labels** and **confidence scores**  
- Export models to multiple formats: **ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite**  
- Easy integration with **Python (OpenCV + Ultralytics)**
